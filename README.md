## Conception & Planning

One piece of advice for planning our projects was to make another version of an existing website. On of my favorite websites/apps is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, a social media for books: what you're currently reading and your progress, what you have read and your ratings/reviews, and what you want to read. That's the basic gist of it anyway.
