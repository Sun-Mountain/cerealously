## Conception & Planning

One piece of advice for planning our projects was to make another version of an existing website. On of my favorite websites/apps is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, a social media for books: what you're currently reading and your progress, what you have read and your ratings/reviews, and what you want to read. That's the basic gist of it anyway.

## Use The App
https://cerealously.herokuapp.com/

## Unsolved Problems
Without user authentication it is even easier to spam/break this app. User authentication would definitely be a step in the right direction. However, ideally if I could connect it to an API where people could select their cereal of choice and just input their review (and rating) of the products. This would also solve the issue of finding pictures that will fit well into the layout rather than entrusting the users to pick one.

## For The Future
:o: Add user authentication.

:o: Create a real logo for the app.

:o: Adjust layout colors.

:o: Convert CSS to SASS.

:o: Add star rating stystem for cereals.

__Reach Goals__

:o: Find & connect to a cereal/grocery API so that people could just search for and pick out the cereals so they don't have to hunt down the information/facts. Then I could theoretically include health information as well.
